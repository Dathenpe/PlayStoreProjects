Alright. Please let me know if you change your mind or need something else.
Understood. Is there anything else I can help with?
No problem. Feel free to ask if anything comes up.
Okay. What can I assist you with instead?
Understood. Is there something different you'd like to do?
Got it. Let me know if there's another way I can assist.
Understood. I'll hold off on that. What's next?
Okay. I won't proceed with that. How else can I help?
No worries. Is there an alternative I can help with?
Understood. Standing by for your next instruction.
Alright. I'll cancel that. Anything else on your mind?
Understood. Let me know if you have a different request.
No problem at all. What would you like to do then?
Okay. I've stopped that. How can I assist you now?
Understood. If you reconsider just let me know.
Got it. I'll disregard that. What's the new plan?
Understood. No action taken on that. What else?
Okay. That's clear. Is there something else I can do?
No problem. Happy to help with something different.
Understood. I'll wait for further instructions.
Alright. Noted. What's the alternative?
Understood. If you need anything else just say the word.
No problem. I'm here if you need me for another task.
Okay. I understand. What's your preference now?
Understood. I'll await your next command.
Got it. So not that. What can I do for you then?
Understood. I'll make sure not to do that. What's next?
Okay. Message received. How would you like to proceed?
No worries at all. Is there another task I can handle?
Understood. I'll keep that in mind. Anything else?
Alright. That's fine. Let me know if your plans change.
Understood. I'm ready for a different instruction.
No problem. Just let me know what you'd prefer.
Okay. I hear you. What's the next course of action?
Understood. I'll put a pin in that. What else can I help with?
Got it. So we're not doing that. What are we doing?
Understood. I'll avoid that. How can I be of service?
Okay. That's perfectly fine. Is there another way I can assist?
No problem. Your preferences are noted. What's next?
Understood. I'll hold back on that. Anything else you need?
Alright. I won't. What would you like me to do instead?
Understood. If there's a change of heart I'm here.
No problem. Let's try something else then. What do you suggest?
Okay. I'll make a note of that. How can I help you now?
Understood. I'll refrain from that. What's the next step?
Got it. That's off the table. What's on the table?
Understood. I'll steer clear of that. What else is there?
Okay. I won't proceed. Is there something else I can assist with?
No problem. Always happy to adjust. What's your new request?
Understood. I'll pause that. Let me know when you're ready for something else.
Alright. That's a no-go. What's the yes-go?
Understood. I'll make sure that doesn't happen. What can I do?
No problem. Your wish is my command (within reason!). What's next?
Okay. I'll cancel that action. How else can I be of service?
Understood. I'll file that under 'don't do'. What's the 'do'?
Got it. No action will be taken. What's your next command?
Understood. I'll halt that process. Is there another task?
Okay. That's duly noted. What would you like to do now?
No worries. I'm flexible. What's the alternative plan?
Understood. I'll make sure to remember that. Anything else?
Alright. I'll stand down on that. What's the new directive?
Understood. If you need me to do something else just ask.
No problem. I'm here to help with what you *do* want.
Okay. I'll make sure that's not done. What can I do for you?
Understood. I'll hold off. Let me know if I can assist differently.
Got it. So that's a no. What's a yes?
Understood. I'll make a mental note. What's next on the agenda?
Okay. I won't do that. Is there something else you'd prefer?
No problem at all. I'm ready for a different task if you have one.
Understood. I'll make sure to avoid that. How else can I help?
Alright. That's clear. What's the next instruction?
Understood. If you have other plans I'm ready.
No problem. Just tell me what you'd like instead.
Okay. I'll make sure that's not on the list. What is?
Understood. I'll refrain. What can I do for you at this moment?
Got it. That won't happen. What will happen?
Understood. I'll make sure to skip that. What's the next item?
Okay. I'll avoid that. Is there another way I can be of assistance?
No problem. Your instructions are clear. What's the new direction?
Understood. I'll make sure to not proceed. What's your command?
Alright. I'll put the brakes on that. What's the green light for?
Understood. If you need a different action I'm all ears.
No problem. Let's pivot. What's the new focus?
Okay. I'll ensure that doesn't occur. How can I help you now?
Understood. I'll make a note to not do that. What's the plan?
Got it. So we'll pass on that. What are we doing instead?
Understood. I'll make sure to hold back. What's the next task?
Okay. That's understood. Is there an alternative you'd like me to pursue?
No worries. I'm here for your other requests. What's next?
Understood. I'll make sure that's not part of the plan. What is?
Alright. That's off. What's on?
Understood. If you need me to do something else feel free to ask.
No problem. I'm ready for a different set of instructions.
Okay. I'll make sure that's not executed. What can I execute for you?
Understood. I'll hold that thought. What's the current thought?
Got it. That's a clear 'no'. What's a clear 'yes'?
Understood. I'll make sure to bypass that. What's the next point?
Okay. I'll make sure to avoid that action. Is there another action I can take?
No problem. Your feedback is noted. What's the new approach?
Understood. I'll make sure that's not initiated. What's your command now?
Alright. I'll stop that. What should I start?
Understood. If you have a different task in mind I'm ready.
No problem. Let's switch gears. What's the new task?
Okay. I'll ensure that's not carried out. How can I assist you at this time?
Understood. I'll make a note to avoid that. What's the current plan?
Got it. So that's not happening. What is happening?
Understood. I'll make sure to pause on that. What's the next priority?
Okay. That's clear as day. Is there an alternative course you'd like?
No problem. I'm here for whatever you decide. What's next?
Understood. I'll make sure that's not on the agenda. What is on the agenda?
Alright. That's a scratch. What's the rewrite?
Understood. If you need me to take a different action just let me know.
No problem. I'm prepared for a change in direction.
Okay. I'll make sure that's not implemented. What can I implement for you?
Understood. I'll put that on hold. What's the active task?
Got it. That's a definite 'don't'. What's a definite 'do'?
Understood. I'll make sure to sidestep that. What's the next objective?
Okay. I'll make sure to steer clear of that. Is there another path I can take?
No problem. Your guidance is appreciated. What's the new strategy?
Understood. I'll make sure that's not commenced. What's your instruction now?
Alright. I'll cease that. What should I commence?
Understood. If you have a different assignment I'm ready to take it on.
No problem. Let's recalibrate. What's the new assignment?
Okay. I'll ensure that's not pursued. How can I be of help to you right now?
Understood. I'll make a note to not engage with that. What's the current engagement?
Got it. So that's on the 'no' list. What's on the 'yes' list?
Understood. I'll make sure to halt progress on that. What's the next step forward?
Okay. That's perfectly understandable. Is there an alternative you'd like me to consider?
No worries. I'm here for your other needs. What's next on your list?
Understood. I'll make sure that's not part of the current operation. What is?
Alright. That's cancelled. What's the new order?
Understood. If you need me to perform a different function just say so.
No problem. I'm ready for a new set of parameters.
Okay. I'll make sure that's not put into effect. What can I put into effect for you?
Understood. I'll suspend that. What's the active directive?
Got it. That's a firm 'negative'. What's a firm 'affirmative'?
Understood. I'll make sure to navigate around that. What's the next waypoint?
Okay. I'll make sure to avoid that route. Is there another route I can explore?
No problem. Your input is valuable. What's the revised plan?
Understood. I'll make sure that's not undertaken. What's your order now?
Alright. I'll discontinue that. What should I continue with?
Understood. If you have a different job for me I'm ready and willing.
No problem. Let's adjust course. What's the new job?
Okay. I'll ensure that's not followed through. How can I assist you in this moment?
Understood. I'll make a note to disengage from that. What's the current focus?
Got it. So that's filed under 'not to do'. What's filed under 'to do'?
Understood. I'll make sure to stop any action there. What's the next action item?
Okay. That's quite clear. Is there an alternative approach you'd prefer?
No problem. I'm at your service for other matters. What's next?
Understood. I'll make sure that's not included in the process. What is included?
